<p>Transactions, driven by human nature, create 3 main forces that drive the economy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Productivity Growth</li>
<li>The Short Term Debt Cycle</li>
<li>The Long Term Debt Cycle</li>
</ul>
<p>The total amount of spending (money + credits) drives the economy.</p>
<p>A market consists of all the buyers and all the sellers making transactions for the same thing.</p>
<p>An economy consists of all the transactions and all the markets.</p>
<p>Central bank controls the amount of money and credits in an economy by influencing the interest rates and printing new money.</p>
<p>Credit is the most important part of the economy because it’s the biggest and most volatile part.</p>
<p>As soon as credit is created, it immediately turns into debt - asset to the lender and liability to the borrower.</p>
<p>When a borrower receives credit he’s able to increase his spending, which drives the economy - one person’s spending is another person’s income.</p>
<p>When someone’s income rises, it makes lenders more willing to lend him money.</p>
<pre><code>                                                Credit (Borrowing) ---&gt; Spending --...
                                                    ^                       |
                                                    |                       |
                                                    |                       v
    Credit (Borrowing) ---&gt; Spending -----&gt; Income &lt;--------------- Productivity
        ^                       |
        |                       |
        |                       v
    Income &lt;--------------- Productivity</code></pre>
<p>This is why we have cycles.</p>
<p>When it comes to growth, productivity matters most in the long run but credit matters most in the short run. This is because productivity growth doesn’t fluctuate much, so it’s not a big driver of economic swings. Debt is, because it allows us to consume more than we produce when we acquire it, and forces us to consume less than we produce when we have to pay it back.</p>
<p>A short term debt cycle takes 5-8 years and a long term debt cycle takes 75-100 years.</p>
<p>In an economy without credit, the only way to increase one’s spending is to increase one’s income, which requires one to be more productive. Increasing the productivity is the only way for growth.</p>
<p>Because we borrow, we have cycles.</p>
<p>Credit is bad when it finances overconsumption that can’t be paid back. It’s good when it efficiently allocates resources and produces income.</p>
<h2 id="the-short-term-debt-cycle">The Short Term Debt Cycle</h2>
<p>Video 12:00</p>
<p>The first phase of the short term debt cycle is expansion. Spending (fueled by credit) increases and outpaces the production of goods, hence prices start to rise (inflation). Central bank raises interest rates to control inflation. Fewer people borrow, leading to less spending, leading to less income, leading to deflation/recession.</p>
<p>In the short term debt cycle spending is constrained only by the willingness of lenders and borrowers to provide and receive credit. When credit is easily available, there’s an economic expansion. When credit isn’t easily available, there’s a recession. This cycle is primarily controlled by the central bank. The short term debt cycle typically last 5-8 years. The bottom and top of each cycle finish with more growth than the previous cycle, and with more debt. Because people have an inclination to borrow and spend more.</p>
<p>Because of this, over a long period of time, debts rise faster than incomes, creating the long term debt cycle.</p>
<h2 id="the-long-term-debt-cycle">The Long Term Debt Cycle</h2>
<p>Video 14:35</p>
<p>Over decades the debt repayments grow larger and larger. At some point debt repayments start to grow faster than incomes, forcing people to cut spending, hence less income, less borrowing.</p>
<p>At the long term debt peak, the debt burdens have become too big. For the United States this happened in 2008.</p>
<p>Now the deleveraging begins. The difference between this and a recession is that the interest rates cannot be lowered to save the day.</p>
<p>Four ways to bring down the debt burdens:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cut spending.</li>
<li>Reduce debt by defaults and restructuring.</li>
<li>Redistribute wealth.</li>
<li>Print money.</li>
</ul>
<p>Cut spending is deflationary, because decreased spending means decreased income.</p>
<p>Debt reduction is also deflationary because it causes income and asset values to decrease.</p>
<p>During deleveraging the central government gets less tax revenues due to less income and less employment, but spending increases due to financial support to the unemployed, and stimulus plans. Budget deficits explode.</p>
<p>Wealth redistribute (typically taxing the rich) can cause social instability.</p>
<p>Printing money is inflationary and stimulative. The central bank can print money and buy assets, driving up the prices of assets, helping the people owning assets. The central bank can also print money and hand it over to the central government by buying government bonds, then the latter can buy goods and services, putting money in the hands of people who don’t own assets.</p>
<p>Balancing the deflationary and inflationary means can create a beautiful deleveraging.</p>
<p>Printing money doesn’t cause inflation. Spending is what matters.</p>

<li>Don’t have debt rise faster than income.</li>
<li>Don’t have income rise faster than productivity.</li>
<li>Do all that you can to raise your productivity.</li>
