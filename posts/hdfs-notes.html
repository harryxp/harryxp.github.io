        <p>Based on <a href="https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-hdfs/HdfsDesign.html">HDFS Architecture</a>. At the time of writing the version is Apache Hadoop 3.0.0-beta1.</p>
<h3 id="q-whats-hdfs">Q: What’s HDFS?</h3>
<p>A: The <em>Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)</em> is a distributed file system. It’s part of the core of Apache Hadoop.</p>
<h3 id="q-what-is-a-distributed-file-system">Q: What is a Distributed File System?</h3>
<p>A: An abstraction. It usually presents itself as a file system that we’re all familiar with, but under the hood files are stored distributedly on multiple hosts.</p>
<h3 id="q-why-do-we-want-that">Q: Why do we want that?</h3>
<p>A: Same reason why we do distributed computing - to deal with huge datasets that one single host will have trouble with.</p>
<h3 id="q-how-do-the-hosts-work-together">Q: How do the hosts work together?</h3>
<p>A: Typically there’s one NameNode and multiple DataNodes. The NameNode is sort of the master and it has all the metadata (how each file is splitted into blocks and where they are, etc.). It also serves as the point of contact for clients.</p>
<h3 id="q-isnt-the-namenode-a-single-point-of-failure-then">Q: Isn’t the NameNode a single point of failure then?</h3>
<p>A: Yeah … but it also makes things simple. And there are ways to mitigate that but it complicates things. Trade-offs.</p>
<h3 id="q-how-does-hdfs-achieve-fault-tolerance">Q: How does HDFS achieve fault-tolerance?</h3>
<p>A: By redundancy! Blocks are replicated and replicas of the same block are never stored on the same node.</p>
