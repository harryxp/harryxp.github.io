<p>I have a pretty big Postgres table of nearly 50+ million rows. Well, I shouldn’t - I should have partitioned it, or used whatever strategy suitable for dealing with such volume of data. But let’s say the way the system was set up doesn’t allow it so I have to deal with one monolithic table.</p>
<p>The use case is to loop over all the rows in this table programmatically. In Perl we can use the <code>DBI</code> library:</p>
<pre><code>my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect(...);
my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare('select * from giant_table');
$dbh-&gt;execute();
while (my $ary_ref = $sth-&gt;fetchrow_arrayref()) {
    # do something with $ary_ref ...
}
$dbh-&gt;disconnect();</code></pre>
<p>You’d think, given that <code>fetchrow_arrayref()</code> returns only one row, it’d be smart about it. That is, rather than retrieve all the 50+ million rows altogether, build some kind of internal cache far smaller and move data one batch at a time. Well, it doesn’t. It took me a while to figure out that <code>execute()</code> moves all the data from target dataset into memory. (Pro tip: just add <code>sleep(60);</code> after <code>execute()</code> and watch <code>htop</code>.)</p>
<p>Actually I think it’s reasonable to implement it this way. First, this makes the behavior of <code>execute()</code> consistent across datasets of different sizes. Second, cursors solve exactly this and <code>DBI</code>, at least <code>DBD::pg</code>, provides a way to do it. You just need to be more explicit about it. <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/DBD-Pg/Pg.pm#Cursors">See the solution here.</a></p>
